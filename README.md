# go-markdown


A small experiment that transforms markdown text into html, the main goal is to use a small htmx instruction and be able to see the result without refreshing the page.

For this example I use [Go](https://go.dev/), [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/), [markdown](https://github.com/gomarkdown/markdown) [htmx](https://htmx.org/), and [tabler](https://tabler.io/) for for appearance.
